  /*! \defgroup UndoBufferFill

    These methods and classes contain the undo functionality for tree changes:
     - Cells aren't deleted. They are moved into an undo buffer instead.
     - The undo buffer is also notified when Cells that are added
     - If the cursor enters a cell the contents of this cell is saved
     - And if the cell is left and the contents has changed this information
       is kept in the undo buffer, as well.
     
    The add and delete actions offer to choose which undo buffer to use since
    there are two of them:
     - The normal undo buffer and
     - The buffer that is used instead if a cell change has been issued by the
       undo command so the undo action can be reverted.\n
       This approach allows the undo functionality to use the regular add and
       delete operations keeping the codebase small.
